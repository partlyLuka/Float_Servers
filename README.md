# Float_Servers
In this project we desired to write servers, which can handle computations regarding sequences.

# User instructions
The code comes with 3 similar servers. All of them offer the same sequences (but with different names), they only differ in their names. The original server's name is Binarni Banditi, the second one is named Binarni Banditi & AmondUs and the third one is names Binarni Banditi & Elves. To use these servers, first run the register, then run all of the main.rs files in the three generator folders. Then you can send requests via the try.py file. There are some test in this script, so when you run it some tests will execute and will let you know if everything is working as it should. Then you can alter the requests in the python script to send other (more complex) sequences to these servers.

# How the family of servers works
You can just run all servers out of the box. They differ in their ip, port, name and the names of the sequences. For example, the Arithmetic sequence is available on the original server aa 'Arithmetic', on the AmongUs server it is under the name 'Arithemtic_Imposter' and on the Elves server it is under the name 'Arithmetic_Elves'. This is by design, so we can test whether the servers can communicate correctly ie. try to request the 'Arithmetic_Imposter' sequence from the original server and see whether it returns the output, even though this sequence is not available on that server, but is on another one. 

You can also run each server with a custom ip, port and register ip via the comman 'cargo run register_ip generator_ip generator_port'.

# Server's capabilities
The server offers some basic capabilities such as responding to /ping requests, /sequence requests, which gives the user the list of sequences available on the server. The main functionality comes from the POST requests. With a POST you may request some elements of some sequence from the server, following the examples from the python script.
